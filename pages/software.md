The following tools I have developed in my research can be found at [GitHub](http://github.com/chen-lin).

## lawic 
Lawic is solving **l**arge **a**mplitude water **w**aves **i**nteracting with underlying **c**urrents. At present, a compiled executable file is provided for analyzing large amplitude waves traveling on rotational flow with constant vorticity, along with postprocessing tools in Python environment and examples with dataset. Find it on [Github](https://github.com/chen-lin/lawic/)

## openmoor
Openmoor is an open-source program for simulating mooring systems in offshore floating wind turbines and wave energy devices. Find the source code and examples at [GitHub](https://github.com/chen-lin/openmoor/) and the tutorial on openmoor official [website](https://openmoor.github.io).


## farx
Fractional-order AutoRegressive model with eXogenous variables (FARX) for building thermo-dynamics can achieve comparable accuracy as classical ARX models while with a largely reduced number of parameters. This largely reduces the identification cost in system identification, therefore facilitating the model-predictive control. Find the code and an example [here](https://github.com/chen-lin/farx/).
