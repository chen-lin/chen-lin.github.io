The following tools I have developed in my research can be found at [GitHub](http://github.com/chen-lin).


## openmoor
Openmoor is an open-source program for simulating mooring systems in offshore floating wind turbines and wave energy devices. Find the source code and examples at [GitHub](https://github.com/chen-lin/openmoor/) and the tutorial on openmoor official [website](https://openmoor.github.io).


## farx
Fractional-order AutoRegressive model with eXogenous variables (FARX) for building thermo-dynamics can achieve comparable accuracy as classical ARX models while with a largely reduced number of parameters. This largely reduces the identification cost in system identification, therefore facilitating the model-predictive control. Find the code and an example [here](https://github.com/chen-lin/farx/).
